DAY 13 Homework

1. Follow VERY CAREFULLY step-by-step instructions on how to use your Microsoft Imagine account to setup a free Azure account.
Instructions are in 333PROJECT directory in BitBucket.

You will need that account for your project and it may take a couple of days to figure out how to set it up so we need to begin right away.

Make sure you're not paying for it (you should NOT be required to provide credit card information, if you are - you're doing it wrong).

FINAL OBJECTIVE: Make sure you're able to create one SQL Database in Azure Portal. You will need it for your project.

2. Complete (if needed) and review your solution of Quiz 1.

3. Complete any homeworks and tasks from this week's classes that you haven't completed yet (Notepad and others).

Upcoming topics of next week include:
* MS SQL Database integration with C#, similar to https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/823854/How-to-connect-SQL-Database-to-your-Csharp-program
Note: There are other methods of connecting to SQL database C# offers but we will use this one because it is the most simple one.
