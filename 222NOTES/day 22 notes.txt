When deleting a record that has dependent records there are 4 options:

1. Do nothing. Do nothing to dependent records -> they will continue referring to OwnerId that no longer exists (foreign key is now broken)

2. Set to null. In database design allow OwnerId to NULL. When owner record is deleted set OwnerId of each dependent record to NULL.

3. Cascade. Delete all dependent record when deleting owner record.

4. Restrict. As long as dependent records exist you are not allowed to delete the owner record.
