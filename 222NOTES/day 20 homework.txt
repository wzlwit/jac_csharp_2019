TASK 1 EF
=========

Create Text Console project Day20CarsAndOwnersEF.

Add Entity Framework via NuGet.

Create DbContext class named ParkingContext.

Create two entities:

class Car { // table Cars
	int Id;
	string MakeModel; // up to 100 characters
	int YearOfProd;
	Owner Owner; // relation, make nullable
}

class Owner { // table Owners
	int Id;
	string Name; // up to 100 characters
	ICollection<Car> CarsCollection; // relation
}

Figure out the difference between eager and lazy loading of related records in Entity Framework.
Find out how to turn it on and off.
Also find out how to load related records later if lazy loading was used.

Your main task will be to implement an application that has the following menu:

1. List all cars and their owner
2. List all owners and their cars
3. Add a car (no owner)
4. Add an owner (no cars)
5. Assign car to a new owner (or no owner)
6. Delete an owner with all cars they own
0. Quit
