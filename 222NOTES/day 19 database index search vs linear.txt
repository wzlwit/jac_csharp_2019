1000 pages

how many pages do you need to look at (in the worst case) to find the page with the name you're looking for?

1000 -> 500
500 -> 250
250 -> 125
125 -> 64
64 -> 32
32 -> 16
16 -> 8
8 -> 4
4 -> 2
2 -> 1


2^10 => 1024

log_2(1024) = 10


If names are NOT sorted the only option find one is to look at each page - linear search - O(n)


If names are sorted then I can find in Log(n)



1000 records -> need to look at 10

1000*1000 => 1 million records -> need to look at 20
