TABLES

Table Cities is pre-populated before program is ran. You should insert at least 4 records into it with valid lat/lng data.

Cities
- Id INT PK IDENT
- CityName NVC(100)
- Latitude Float
- Longitude Float

Trips
- Id INT PK IDENT
- PersonName NVC(100)
- DepartureDate DATE
- ReturnDate DATE
- FromCityId INT FOREIGN KEY -> Cities.Id
- ToCityId INT FOREIGN KEY -> Cities.Id

public class City {
  public int Id;
  public string CityName;
  public double Latitude, Longitude;
}

public class Trip {
  public int Id;
  public string PersonName;
  public DateTime DepartureDate, ReturnDate;
  public int FromCityId, ToCityId;
}

public class TripWithCities {
  public int TripId;
  public string PersonName;
  public int FromCityId, ToCityId;
  public string FromCityName, ToCityName;
  public double FromCityLatitude, FromCityLongitude, ToCityLatitude, ToCityLongitude;
  public DateTime DepartureDate, ReturnDate;
  public double TripDistanceKm; // computed, not stored
}

dual-table join example (not tested):

SELECT ps.Id psId, p1.Id p1Id, ...
FROM Person as ps, Parent as p1, Parent as p2
WHERE ps.motherId = p1.Id AND ps.fatherId = p2.Id

To retrieve it is best to use name of each column, e.g.
int personId = (int)reader["psId"];



Main window - display of list of TripsWithCities.

Add button in menu - when pressed presents WizardSelectFromToCity. When next is pressed WizardSelectFromToCity window is hidden and WizardEnterTripData is shown to create Trip with person data.
When confirmed new record of Trip is created and list in the main window is refreshed.

Create class Database for accessing database tables. Implement ONLY the methods that you actually need, mainly:

public List<TripWithCities> GetAllTripsWithCities() { ... }
public List<City> GetAllCities() { ... }
public void AddTrip(Trip trip) { ... }

MainWindow must be using DockPanel with Menu and ListView (no status bar).

Wizard windows are non-resizable.
