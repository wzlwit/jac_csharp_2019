Project submissions - requirements and guidelines
=================================================

Your grade for the project is based on the following components:
1. Presentation in front of the class,
2. Difficulty of the challenge you took on and quality and
completeness of your solution to it.
How much have you learned from doing the project.

After the presentation you will need to submit these files:
* Presentation PowerPoint or PDF file with slides.
- in comment you MUST include 2 URLs: to Git and to Trello you used.
* Source code of your solution.
* Source code must ALSO be in GitHub public repository.
* Export of the database structure and data.
Except if you have large BLOBs then take screenshots of database structure and data instead.


ADDITIONAL NOTES FOR PHP COURSE ONLY:
* You are required to upload your project to web hosting
to allow the teacher and students to access your project and test it.


Also please note:

As part of the project evaluation teacher reserves the right to interview any student about the code of the project (to make sure he/she is the genuine author of it), as well as to general knowledge of the subjects covered in the course.


Length and Evaluation of the Presentation
-----------------------------------------

You will only have 12 minutes to present plus a couple minutes
to answer questions. On average a person takes about 1 minute
per slide so you should have about 12 slides in your presentation.
The absolute limit is 12-15 slides.

You can do a live demo of your project *after* all presentations
are done but you are *not* allowed to do a live demo as a part
of your presentation.

Games are an exception: you will take 1-2 minutes to do a short demo.
You still have to present for the other 10 minutes.

*Both* members of the project must present and each of them
must talk about more-less 50% of the slides.

Each member of the team is evaluated *individually* for their
contribution to the project and quality of their presentation.


Practice and Adjustments
------------------------

You need to *practice* giving your presentation at least a couple of times,
the day before delivering it. You usually will discover that
some slides need to be split into multiple slides and some
must be removed.

Rule of thumb: if you're spending more than 1 minute on a slide
then either:
- you need to explain less about this slide, or
- you need to split this slide into two or more slides.

You will not know which slides to split until you *practice*
your delivery. I will know, and the class will know if
you haven't practiced and it will affect your grade.


Content of the Presentation
---------------------------

* 1 slide: Title
- title of presentation,
- subject of the project,
- names of team members

* 1 slides: Background, high level view
- Background of the project, e.g.
. explain a game you were implementing,
. explain what was the purpose of system
you were implementing and what problem
does it solve.

* 1-2 slides: Your solution overview
- show your solution from high level, e.g.
screenshot(s), list main features from
user point of view, features, functionalities.
Say WHAT was implemented BUT NO DETAILS ON HOW.

* 3-4 slides: Challenges and solutions
- show database structure here
- talk about each of the technologies you used
and each major problem you had to solve on your own
to make the solution work.

* 2-3 slides: What we learned - teach it! Teach one thing.
- talk about specific, low-level solutions
and teach them to the students and teacher
= Teach me how to solve ONE problem.

* 1 slide: Future work
- say what was not done yet and could be
solved if your project continued.
- don't go too far into the future - what would you have done if you had an extra week?

* 1 slide: Summary
- what was done and with what result.

Total slides count ~12. You are allowed to add more slides
only if you can stay within the 12 minute limit for your presentation.


What Not To Do
==============

These are some of the "don'ts" - mistakes that students presenting make often. Avoid these!

* Skipping practice.
You don't know how your presentation will "flow"
in front of a room until you practiced delivering it.
Sit in front of your computer or stand up and
speak *out loud* to yourself as if you were talking
to a room full of people.

Deliver the content of each slide.
Make corrections.
Repeat.

If you don't practice it will show and you will lose marks.

* Skipping breakfast this morning.

* Speaking too fast, or mumbling.

* Putting too much text or code on a slide.
You must not have more than 40 words per slide.
If you do - you will lose marks.

* Fonts too small
If your font is too small to read by someone sitting at the
back (that's where the teacher is sitting during presentation)
you will lose marks.

* Too much code
It is okay to take a screenshot of a 5-15 lines of code
when talking about your solution. But if there's too many lines
then code becomes unreadable and you will lose marks.

* Irrelevant content
The presentation must flow from one item to another.
If you put in an item and the audience is wondering why
was it even there because it does not seem relevant
- you will lose marks.

* More than 2 font types, more than 3 font sizes,
use of animations, unreadable colors.
Any of the above will have you lose marks.

* Reading from a slide when presenting.
If all you do is read from a slide when you're presenting
then it looks like either you don't know what you're talking
about or you have not practiced.
Either way - if you're reading from a slide will lose marks.

* Skipping practice (yes again).
This is the only way to get your presentation into good shape.
Practice or your presentation will not be great.
