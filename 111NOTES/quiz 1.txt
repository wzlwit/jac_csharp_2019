Quiz 1 - DotNet
===============

Create new project Quiz1Triple.

In the main class create 3 methods:

static void GPACalculator() {}
static void FibChecker() {}
static void MatrixMultiplier() {}

suggested helper method for GPA calculations:
static double LetterGradetoNumber(String grade) {}


IMPORTANT: For 100% grade you only need to implement 2 out of the 3 methods listed above. You choose yourself which one you prefer to implement.

Implementation of GPACalculator method
--------------------------------------

Keep asking user for their grades, one per line until an empty line is entered.
Grades are letter grades such as: F, D, C-, C, C+, B-, B, B+, A-, A.
Each grade has an assigned numerical value in 4.0 scale as described in https://gradecalc.info/ca/qc/mcgill/gpa_calc.pl


Display grades back to the user along with their numerical values;
Calculate the numerical average of all grades and display it.

If an invalid grade is entered you should display an error message and terminate the program.

Example session:

Enter letter grades, one per line:
B-
A-
C

You've entered:
B- which is 2.7
A- which is 3.7
C  which is 2.0

The GPA average is: 2.8



Implementation of FibChecker() method
-------------------------------------

Ask user for a number.
Verify if the number is a Fibonacci number.
Display the nearest larger Fibonacci number.

If user enters a negative number of something that is not a number display an error message and terminate the program.

Note: you are allowed to create a helper method to generate fibonacci numbers if you like.

Example session:

Enter a number to check against Fibonacci: 345
345 is not a Fibonacci number
the next Fibonacci number is 377


Implementation of MatrixMultiplier method
-----------------------------------------

Ask user for two matrices. First one is 2 by 3, second is 3 by 2.
Perform matrix multiplication and display the result.

Matrix multiplication https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)#Matrix_multiplication

Example session:

Enter the first matrix 2 lines of 3 numbers, comma-separated:
1,2,3
4,5,6
Enter the second matrix 3 lines of 2 numbers, comma-separated:
1,2
3,4
5,6

The result of multiplication is:
22,28
49,64


Note: you may use String.Split() method to separate numbers that are comma-separated.

Note: you are NOT allowed to copy and paste a general matrix multiplication algorithm.

Main method
-----------

Main method is up to you. You can, for example just call each of the 3 methods above to test your program.


What to submit
--------------

Close VisualStudio. Create ZIP file (NOT RAR, 7ZIP, or anything else) of your project and upload it to LEA dropbox as your solution to the quiz.
You do NOT need to name the file in any special way, the system and I will know it came from you.
