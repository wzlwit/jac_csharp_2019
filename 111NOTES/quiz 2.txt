DAY 06 - quiz 2 - PeopleTravel
==============================

Create a new project Quiz2PeopleTravel

Add the following class definition.

class PersonTravels {
	string Name; // 2-50 characters long
	int Age; // 0-150
	string PassportNo; // two uppercase letters followed by six digits exactly - use regexp
	List<string> CountriesVisited = new List<string>();
	public void AddCountryUnique(string country) { ... }
	public override string ToString() { ...	}
}

Make sure to encapsulate all fields (obligatory) except CountriesVisited.
You may add constructor(s) if you like (optional).

On failed validation in setters you will throw custom exception InvalidDataException() with message as parameter.


Input file "data.txt":

Jerry;33;AB123545;USA,Germany,France
Marianna;29;ZZ112233;Japan,Nigeria,USA,Ukraine
Tom;57;NN778855;
Mimi;44;NM343434;USA,France

You must handle all possible invalid inputs from file by informing the user with a message and skipping the invalid line. You must continue parsing further lines.

Menu:
1. Display all people and countries they traveled to
2. Add person and countries visited
3. Register a new country visited by a person
4. Find out who visited most countries
5. List all who visited a specific country
0. Exit

Suggested decomposition - create one method for each menu item.
You will also need one method to read data from file (at the start of the program) and another method to write data back to file (when program is about to exit).

Printout of information about each PersonTravels to console should use ToString() method you will implement.

For full marks you you MUST decompose your task into methods in the main class, just like we did it in previous examples.

You are also required to use proper error handling, exception propagation, problem decomposition, self-documenting code, etc.
