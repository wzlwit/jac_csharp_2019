DAY 02 HOMEWORK
===============

Day02Names
----------

Create new project in called Day02Names.

Declare List<Strings> as nameList.

In a loop ask user for a name.
If name is not empty add name to the list and continue to next iteration of the loop.
If name is empty - exit the loop.

After loop is done print out all the names, one per line.


Day02Numbers
------------

Ask user how many numbers he/she wants to generate.
Generate the numbers as random integers in -100 to +100 range, both inclusive.
Place the numbers in List<int> named numList.

In a next loop find the numbers that are less or equal to 0 and print them out, one per line.


Day02NamesAgain
---------------

Declare:

String[] nameList = new nameList[5];

In a loop ask user for each name and put it into the array.

Ask user for a search string and save it in String 'search' variable;

In another loop find all names that contain the search string and display them.

In another loop find the longest name and display it.

Example session:

Enter a name: Jerry
Enter a name: Malexandra
Enter a name: Trixie
Enter a name: Tom
Enter a name: Barry

Enter search string: rr

Matching name: Jerry
Matching name: Barry

Longest name is: Malexandra


Your solution should NOT use sorting.
You are not allowed to use LINQ either.


Day02Tree
---------

Create a program that will ask the user:
How big does your tree needs to be?
Then using '*' character display a tree of wanted size.

Example session:

How big does your tree needs to be? 4

   *
  ***
 *****
*******

Suggestion first try to display a triangle of wanted size:

*
**
***
****
*****
Then display the reverse triangle
    
   *
  **
 ***
****

Then combine your solutions.


Day02ArrayContains
------------------

In this exercise you're asked to create several methods.

It is up to you to create test cases in Main() method to test your solutions.

Note: you are NOT allowed to use List<> in this exercise.


* Part 1:

Create method with the following signature:

public int[] Concatenate(int[] a1, int[] a2) { }

Return an array that is a concatenation of the two arrays passed.
Example: if I pass { 2, 7, 8} and { -2, 9} I will receive back array
{ 2, 7, 8, -2, 9 }


* Part 2:

Write a method with the following signature:

public static void PrintDups(int[] a1, int a2[]) { }

That method will print out only values that appear both in a1 and a2.
If a1 contains multiple values that are the same you may print them out multiple times.

For arrays:
a1: 1, 3, 7, 8, 2, 7, 9, 11
a2: 3, 8, 7, 5, 13, 5, 12
Output is:
3
7
8
7

* Part 3

Create method with the following signature:

public int[] RemoveDups(int[] a1, int[] a2) { }

Return a copy of a1, except elements that are also present in a2 are removed.
Note: returned array must be of exactly the needed size, not larger.

Example: removeDups({2, 3, 5, 7, 3, 2}, {3, 9, 7}) will return array of two elements exactly: {2, 5, 2}


* Part 4

Write a method with the following signature:

public static void PrintDups(int[,] a1, int a2[,]) { }

That method will print out only values that appear both in a1 and a2.
If a1 contains multiple values that are the same you may print them out multiple times.

NOTE: In this case both arrays are TWO DIMENSIONAL.


Day02People
-----------

Declare two arrays:

String namesArray = new String[4];
int agesArray = new int[4];

Ask user for names and ages of for people and save the information in the arrays.

Find the youngest person and display their name and age.

Example session:
Enter name of person #1: Jerry
Enter age  of person #1: 33
Enter name of person #2: Tom
Enter age  of person #2: 22
Enter name of person #3: Marianna
Enter age  of person #3: 56
Enter name of person #4: Lucy
Enter age  of person #4: 27

Youngest person is 22 and their name is Tom


Day02RandomWeather
------------------

Your program will generate a random integer value in the -30 to +30 range (both inclusive). You will display the value to the user.
Then using if/else/if/else/... chain you will display message depending on the temperature:
* if temperature is below or equal -15 display "Very very cold"
* if temperature is above -15 but below 0 display "Freezing already"
* if temperature is between 0 and 15 (both inclusive) display "Spring or Fall"
* if temperature is above 15 display "That's what I like"
