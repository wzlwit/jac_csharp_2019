TASK 1
======

Part 1 - basics and user input / output
---------------------------------------

Create new project Day01Review. Make sure project is placed in Git's Working Copy folder.

Ask user for 3 integer numbers: minimum, maximum, count.

Generate and print out 'count' random numbers between minimum and maximum (both inclusive).
When printed out numbers must be separated by a comma and space.

Example session:

Enter minimum: 3
Enter maximum: 10
Enter how many numbers to generate: 4

Numbers generated: 7, 5, 3, 9

Press any key to exit

Part 2 - error handling
-----------------------

Make sure your program does not crash if user enters an invalid number that is not an integer. Display an error message "Error: Value entered must be an integer" and end program.

Make sure minimum is not larger than maximum. If it is display message "Error: minimum can not be larger than maximum" and end program.

Make sure count is an integer (like above) and is 1 or greater. If it is not display message "Error: you must generate 1 or more numbers" and end program.

Part 3 - more user friendly
---------------------------

If user enters a value that is not a valid integer display error message and keep asking user to enter a valid integer until successful.


TASK 2 - HOMEWORK
=================

Using Visual Studio create a "C# Console" project. Name the project Day01Hello
In its Main method program the following behaviour. 

Ask user for their name (String).

Ask user for their age (Integer).

Then display a greeting using that information.

Additionally, if user age is below 18 display "You are not an adult yet".

Example session

Enter your name: Jerry
Enter your age: 13
Hi Jerry, you are 13 y/o.
You are not an adult yet.

Later: add error handling for when age entered is not a valid integer, or is negative.


TASK 3 - HOMEWORK
=================

Create console project Day01Find.

Ask user to enter 5 floating point values.
Save those 5 values in an array (List is also acceptable).

NOT using any library tools (for sorting or searching for min/max, etc.) but only loops and ifs find out and print:
- the smallest of the numbers
- the sum of all the numbers
- the average of all the those values
- standard deviation of those values (read the Wikipedia article to find out how)

Decompose your program into separate 5 methods, each to accomplish one of the tasks above.
Method names are as follows (parameters and return values are up to you):
EnterValues(), FindSmallestNumber(), FindSumOfAllNumbers(), FindAverage(), FindStandardDeviation().

Note: if user enters a value that is not a valid floating point number display an error message and exit.
